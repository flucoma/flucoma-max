# Instructions for the Max version of the Fluid Corpus Manipulation toolbox

## How to start:

1) move the full `FluidCorpusManipulation` folder in your Packages folder (~/Documents/Max/Packages/), and restart Max.

There is now an 'extras' giving the overview of the toolbox, and a shortcut (shift-f) to create fluid.* objects. Full documentation, and examples, are also available.

> We use `maxsubstitution` in the various text files of the `init` folder of the package. If you are using Max 7 you will see an error "max doesn't understand definesubstitution". You can ignore this. 

#### Enjoy!
